# _Blockchain_

This directory contains the code of the LoraResolver smart contract used in the project Decentralized LoRa infrastructure using blockchain. The smart contract is in the /contracts directory.

To deploy the LoraResolver smart contract, many different solutions exists. Two of them which have been tested are: the [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) and the [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). For testing locally the interactions of the _FNS_ and the _AS_ with the _Blockchain_, the Truffle Suite is practical to use. But, for deploying the smart contract on the Ethereum Mainnet or on an Ethereum Testnet, the Remix Ethereum IDE is recommended.

The command to use the Truffle Suite are in the command.txt file.
